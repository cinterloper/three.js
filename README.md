Origional cred to mrdoob
I picked through kabbi's patches to r71 for three on node-webgl
https://github.com/kabbi/three.js/commit/d97012f8234796b9e0291e6f6e965e293d950099

I have ported that patchset to r73 here. its mostly working, however the 'example-performance.js' example from kabbi shows a white screen and produces no error output.. maybe i missed something, further investigation required.
